Welcome back to SnapSound. Today, we're diving into Atomic Habits by James Clear.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,820
Absolutely. This book is all about how small habits can lead to big changes.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,800
That idea of getting 1% better every day really stuck with me. Can you explain it?

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,800
Sure. If you improve just 1% daily, you'll be 37 times better in a year.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,280
Small gains compound.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,760
I liked how the book focused on identity-based habits.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,500
Exactly. Instead of, I want to run, say, I'm a runner. You change your identity, not just your goals.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Thanks. That was really helpful. This was a great conversation.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,760
Absolutely. Let's keep stacking those habits. See you next time on SnapSound.
